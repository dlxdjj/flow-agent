# Flow Agent current status

Last reviewed: 2026-07-17

Development branch: `agent/v1-full`

Current functional code commit: `311306d`

This file is the short, current source of truth. The
[implementation plan](WIDGET_V1_PLAN.md),
[acceptance contract](V1_ACCEPTANCE.md), and milestone verification records
provide the detailed requirements and evidence.

## Status at a glance

- **Functional implementation:** delivered through M13 on
  `agent/v1-full`.
- **Latest functional milestone:** M13 Provider-owned approval-state
  coordination.
- **Latest local gates:** 153 workspace tests passed, two explicit/manual
  tests ignored; zero-warning Clippy, format, release build, five-round native
  request replay, isolated browser QA, and the two-minute resource gate passed.
- **M13 real-Provider acceptance:** still pending. The milestone was committed
  and pushed at the user's direction before this final manual confirmation.
- **Final v1 release:** not yet declared. The required continuous 48-hour
  Runtime RSS soak remains unchecked.
- **Default GitHub branch:** `main` still points to the M0 bootstrap. The full
  development branch remains unmerged and must not be merged or made default
  without separate user approval.
- **Version/tag:** Cargo remains `0.1.0`; no release tag has been created.

## Milestone matrix

| Milestone | Scope | Implementation | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| M0 | Provider Hook control path | Complete | [M0](M0_VERIFICATION.md) |
| M1 | Persistent Runtime core | Complete | [M1](M1_VERIFICATION.md) |
| M2 | Authenticated API and minimum UI | Complete | [M2](M2_VERIFICATION.md) |
| M3 | Safe install, onboarding, and Doctor | Complete | [M3](M3_VERIFICATION.md) |
| M4 | Quota, settings, and local data controls | Complete | [M4](M4_VERIFICATION.md) |
| M5 | Release hardening and evidence | Partial | [M5](M5_VERIFICATION.md); 48-hour soak pending |
| M6 | Live sessions and Attention linkage | Complete | [M6](M6_VERIFICATION.md) |
| M7 | Dynamic quota and truthful timing | Complete | [M7](M7_VERIFICATION.md) |
| M8 | Desktop compatibility, ignore, jump, and recovery truth | Complete | [M8](M8_VERIFICATION.md) |
| M9 | Provider conversation-title consistency | Complete | [M9](M9_VERIFICATION.md) |
| M10 | Configurable safe display | Complete | [M10-M12](M10_M12_VERIFICATION.md) |
| M11 | Direct Claude questions and secret handling | Complete | [M10-M12](M10_M12_VERIFICATION.md) |
| M12 | Codex Connector and restart recovery | Complete within the recorded boundary | [M10-M12](M10_M12_VERIFICATION.md) |
| M13 | Provider-owned approval-state coordination | Code and automated gates complete; real-Provider acceptance pending | [M13](M13_PROVIDER_STATE_COORDINATION.md) |

M5 is a release-qualification track, not the chronological end of feature
development. Later functional milestones may be implemented while M5's
long-running release gate remains open; that does not make the final v1 release
complete.

## Capability boundary after M13

Flow Agent can directly respond only when it owns a live, official reply
channel:

- request-keyed Claude/Codex Hook `PermissionRequest` allow, deny, or
  pass-through;
- Claude `AskUserQuestion` and `Elicitation` Hook replies;
- Codex app-server `item/tool/requestUserInput` after explicit managed attach.

When Codex or Claude exposes an approval only in its own native interface, Flow
Agent observes and synchronizes the waiting/resolved state. It must not show
fake allow/deny controls or infer whether the user approved, denied, or ran the
command.

## Proposed next milestone, not implemented

M14 is reserved for version-gated managed Codex app-server approval methods:

- `item/commandExecution/requestApproval`;
- `item/fileChange/requestApproval`;
- `item/permissions/requestApproval`;
- official available-decision rendering and response;
- `serverRequest/resolved` and item completion reconciliation;
- explicit UI capability labels and compatibility tests.

M14 does not promise control of an arbitrary independently running Codex
Desktop conversation. It requires a supported, explicitly attached managed
Thread and must be separately planned, implemented, tested, and approved.

## Remaining release work

1. Complete M13 manual reproduction against the real Provider surfaces and
   record the user's result.
2. Run and retain the continuous 48-hour Runtime RSS soak on the exact frozen
   release candidate.
3. Re-run the full release gate after any resulting change.
4. Obtain separate approval for commit/push of documentation changes.
5. Obtain separate approval before merging `agent/v1-full` into `main`, changing
   the default branch, bumping the version, tagging, or publishing a release.
