# Flow Agent v1 delivery contract

Source baseline: `WIDGET_V1_PLAN.md` v1.1 dated 2026-07-15, amended by the
M0-M13 verification records and summarized in `STATUS.md`. This
repository file keeps the milestone gates next to the implementation; it does
not weaken or replace the full plan.

## Release shape

- One Rust binary, `flow-agent`.
- macOS-first local runtime plus embedded 1600x600 native web UI.
- Three modules only: Attention, Agent sessions, and Quota.
- Claude Code and Codex local sessions are P0, whether launched from their CLI
  or macOS desktop app. A global provider CLI is not a prerequisite when the
  supported desktop app is present. Gemini round-level observation is P1 and
  cannot block v1 release.
- External Hook Control handles each official permission request through
  approve, deny, or pass-through. Multiple sessions may wait concurrently, but
  every waiter is request-keyed and receives exactly one outcome. v1.1 adds
  Claude's official AskUserQuestion/Elicitation Hook replies and an explicit,
  version-gated Codex app-server Connector for requestUserInput and Thread
  recovery. Interrupt, steer, Coach, cloud accounts, and telemetry remain out
  of scope.

## Milestone gates

### M0 - provider control path

- [x] Reference review records exact revisions, licenses, adopted decisions,
      rejected patterns, and milestone ownership.
- [x] Versioned, sanitized Claude and Codex fixtures from real probes.
- [x] Session, prompt, tool, permission, and stop events form basic state.
- [x] Real allow and deny produce subsequent provider evidence.
- [x] Undo before three seconds writes no provider decision.
- [x] Manual pass-through restores the native provider prompt.
- [x] Injected deadline pass-through works.
- [x] Claude uses a 24-hour human-approval budget and Codex uses 1 hour;
      automated tests inject short deadlines.
- [x] Hook stdin that never closes fails open within its 5-second budget.
- [x] Missing runtime completes within 200ms with empty stdout.
- [x] Killing the runtime while waiting immediately returns native control.
- [x] Another Codex hook denial cannot become a false confirmation.
- [x] Untrusted Codex hooks show not connected; a trusted probe connects.
- [x] Capability matrix and integration boundary report are current.

### M1 - runtime core

- [x] Core state machine and attention rules are fixture-tested.
- [x] SQLite WAL storage uses one writer and transactional business actions.
- [x] Envelope replay is idempotent.
- [x] Approve/deny/pass-through races have one winner.
- [x] Waiters are memory-only and stale approvals expire after restart.
- [x] Concurrent waiters are keyed by request/correlation ID, and duplicate
      requests resolve an older waiter without leaking its decision.
- [x] Socket half-close is not treated as user disconnect or auto-deny.
- [x] Stop remains turn-end; process liveness reconciles sessions that emit no
      terminal session event.
- [x] Runtime is single-instance; non-permission spool is bounded and replayed.

### M2 - API and minimum UI

- [x] Authenticated localhost API and WebSocket snapshot are implemented.
- [x] The fixed three-column 1600x600 UI has no fake data.
- [x] Attention supports approve, deny, undo, pass-through, ack, and snooze.
- [x] UI distinguishes pending, sent, confirmed, passed-through, and expired.
- [x] Real Claude and Codex approval paths pass end to end.

### M3 - installation and onboarding

- [x] Claude and Codex hook installation uses backup, semantic merge, lock,
      temporary file, and atomic rename.
- [x] Uninstall removes only Flow Agent entries and preserves user semantics.
- [x] Installation intent is tri-state and repair never recreates intentionally
      removed or uninstalled hooks.
- [x] Stable hook binary installation, `CODEX_HOME`, canonical/legacy feature
      detection, and Codex trust guidance are implemented.
- [x] `doctor` reports CLI/version, configuration, runtime, trust/probe state,
      control loop, and pass-through.
- [x] `doctor` emits structured, repairability-aware issues and refuses to
      mutate malformed provider configuration.
- [x] `doctor` reports an overlong Unix Socket path before attempting Hook
      installation or Runtime startup.
- [x] Unknown fields and events are visible and never panic.

### M4 - quota, settings, and P1

- [x] Claude quota bridge never silently replaces an existing custom status
      line; explicit wrapper mode preserves its visible output and restores
      the complete original object on uninstall.
- [x] Codex rollout parsing is isolated, structurally validated, bounded, and read-only.
- [x] Stale quota keeps its last real value and capture time; missing or
      incompatible data remains honestly unavailable.
- [x] Notification, retention, export, and destructive-clear settings work.
- [x] Gemini round-level observation is intentionally not shipped in v1; it
      remains optional P1 and did not block either P0 provider.

### M5 - release qualification track

M5 is a parallel release gate. Later functional milestones can be implemented
without making the final v1 release complete.

- [x] Local metrics and JSON export match the plan definitions.
- [x] Oversize/deep JSON, host/origin/CSRF, socket permissions, and redaction
      tests pass.
- [x] Default logs contain no raw hook payload; diagnostic capture is explicit,
      redacted, bounded, and expires.
- [x] Hook non-blocking p95 is below 50ms; event-to-UI p95 below 300ms.
- [x] Idle runtime CPU is below 0.5%; short Runtime/browser resource gates are
      within budget.
- [ ] Runtime RSS remains below 80MB throughout a continuous 48-hour soak on
      the exact frozen release candidate.
- [x] Every pass-through path leaves the Provider interface usable.

### M6 - live sessions and Attention linkage

- [x] The main list keeps active, attention-bearing, and last-30-minute
      sessions only.
- [x] Attention-bearing sessions remain visible regardless of age.
- [x] Selecting an attention item selects, pins, highlights, focuses, and
      reveals its corresponding Agent session.
- [x] Agent rows expose factual thinking/tool/waiting/completed/failed/idle
      activity without inventing unavailable tool detail.
- [x] Timer ticks update text without rebuilding the full task row.
- [x] Claude and Codex use locally served image marks throughout the UI.

### M7 - dynamic quota and truthful timing

- [x] Quota renders every valid Provider window without a fixed weekly label.
- [x] Codex fixture families remain regression evidence while future versions
      are accepted only when the same bounded numeric schema validates.
- [x] Last valid quota values remain visible with their real capture time;
      stale age never fabricates freshness or percentage.
- [x] A Claude cache created after an unavailable snapshot refreshes
      immediately instead of waiting for the normal poll.
- [x] Existing Claude status-line output is preserved by explicit wrapper mode
      and restored exactly on uninstall.
- [x] Agent rows show factual total-turn time plus current-phase time.

### M8 - desktop compatibility and truthful control

- [x] Claude.app and ChatGPT/Codex.app can satisfy Provider discovery without a
      global same-name CLI.
- [x] Codex trust remains a user-controlled `/hooks` review and is never
      written or bypassed by Flow Agent.
- [x] Provider-handled progress/resolution removes matching stale Attention and
      task waiting state only when a reliable signal exists.
- [x] Attention supports safe ignore/dismiss and a visible exit transition.
- [x] Jump labels/actions distinguish exact conversation, matching
      Terminal/iTerm, application-only, and unsupported environments.
- [x] Running presentation and turn start survive Runtime restart; old reply
      channels do not, and private jump locators never enter browser snapshots.
- [x] Token/usage fields appear only when supplied by a real structured source.

### M9 - Provider title consistency

- [x] Claude official `session_title` is accepted directly from the Hook.
- [x] Claude custom/AI JSONL titles and Codex `thread_name` are local-only,
      bounded compatibility sources; unknown or absent metadata falls back.
- [x] Provider title, project, and bounded current task remain separate fields;
      the UI intentionally renders title, task content, and model only.
- [x] Recent title changes refresh without restarting the Runtime.
- [x] SQLite v4 upgrades in place to v5 with no session loss.
- [x] Title priority, privacy, API snapshot, and UI rendering are automated.
- [x] Format, zero-warning Clippy, 127-test workspace suite, release build,
      five-round Claude/Codex control replay, and 120-second resource gate pass.
- [x] Exact release installed locally; Runtime/control loop, real Provider
      events, live title rendering, and browser console checks pass.
- [x] User completes Codex's official `/hooks` re-trust and accepts the build.
- [x] Local commit authorized by the user on 2026-07-17.
- [x] GitHub push authorized separately by the user after final local acceptance.

### M10 - configurable safe display

- [x] Settings provide concise, detailed, and developer profiles.
- [x] Task-card fields are selected from a server-owned allowlist and persist
      across Runtime/UI restart.
- [x] The safe catalog covers project/task/model/activity/plan/usage, sanitized
      current tool, permission mode, child-Agent count, environment, recovery,
      control and developer IDs when those facts exist.
- [x] A detail drawer uses only the same safe field catalog.
- [x] Unknown fields and raw/payload/full-command/transcript requests are
      rejected; raw Hook payload is never directly rendered.

### M11 - Agent questions in Attention

- [x] Claude AskUserQuestion supports one-to-four questions, choice,
      multi-select, and free input using official updatedInput.answers output.
- [x] Claude Elicitation supports accept, decline, cancel, typed fields, and
      official hookSpecificOutput.
- [x] Secret fields use password inputs and answers exist only in the DOM,
      authenticated request body, in-memory waiter, and one Provider response.
- [x] Answers never enter SQLite, logs, diagnostics, snapshots, or exports.
- [x] Expired questions cannot be submitted; handing a Claude question back to
      native Provider UI emits no directive.
- [x] Hook-only Codex sessions never display a fake direct-answer input.

### M12 - managed Codex and restart recovery

- [x] The Connector initializes with experimental API capability through a
      private persistent official app-server Unix Socket and proxy transport;
      it does not require Codex's standalone-only daemon command.
- [x] Explicit attach uses thread/list and thread/resume; managed Thread IDs
      persist and are rejoined after Flow Agent restarts.
- [x] item/tool/requestUserInput maps to the same memory-only question model
      and writes ToolRequestUserInputResponse keyed by official question IDs.
- [x] External Hook sessions use captured parent-process liveness and expose
      observing, waiting-for-event, lost-control, or ended truthfully.
- [x] Managed sessions expose controllable only after a real app-server resume;
      other Codex sessions remain external_hook.
- [x] Runtime restart restores session display but expires every old approval
      and question waiter; no disconnected stdout/RPC continuation is revived.
- [x] Full workspace/release gates and the two-minute resource gate pass on the
      exact candidate.
- [x] Exact candidate is installed locally and accepted by the user on
      2026-07-17 before any commit or GitHub push.

### M13 - Provider-owned approval-state coordination

- [x] Codex auto-review/guardian ownership avoids a competing Flow Agent
      blocking waiter.
- [x] Native `PreToolUse(request_permissions)` creates an observation-only
      waiting item with no replyable request ID.
- [x] Matching Provider lifecycle or managed Thread status resolves native
      waiting neutrally without claiming approve, deny, or execution.
- [x] Incidental running/tool activity cannot overwrite an explicit native
      waiting state.
- [x] Managed `waitingOnApproval` and Hook waiting deduplicate by Session.
- [x] Provider resolution clears notifications, stale Attention, task `等你`,
      and any competing unsent waiter transactionally.
- [x] Native approval UI exposes only original-Agent handling, snooze, and
      ignore; Flow-controlled approval retains allow/deny/pass-through.
- [x] Five-round native lifecycle replay, 153-test workspace suite,
      zero-warning Clippy, format, release build, two-minute resource gate, and
      isolated browser QA pass.
- [x] Candidate committed and pushed as `311306d` at the user's explicit
      direction.
- [ ] Real Claude/Codex Provider manual acceptance is recorded after reproducing
      both native waiting and native resolution on the installed candidate.

## Publishing rule

Each milestone is implemented test-first. A test-candidate branch push requires
its automated/local gates and explicit user authorization. A milestone is not
marked accepted until its required manual evidence also passes. Failed or
incomplete gates remain visible and are never represented as complete in
documentation, tags, or releases. Merging to `main`, changing the default
branch, versioning, tagging, and publishing a release require separate user
approval.
